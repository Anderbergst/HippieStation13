# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, this gets changed to [] after reading.  Just remove the brackets when you add new shit.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("). It works without them, but if you use certain characters it screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes: 
  - rscadd: "Adds maximum player caps for lowpop-intended gamemodes. Currently Abductors is capped at 45 players, although admins can still force these gamemodes above this playercount."
  - tweak: "Increased the minimum playercount for Traitors+Changelings and Gangs to 25, from 0 and 20 respectively."
  - experiment: "Increased the amount of gangs that can appear in a single round. This was previously 2-3 depending on population and is now 3-5."
  - tweak: "Recalling the shuttle from your gangtool now costs 25 influence the first time, and doubles for every subsequent successful recall. If the recall fails, you will be refunded."
  - tweak: "Increased the price of all of the Rigatoni Gang's equipment."
